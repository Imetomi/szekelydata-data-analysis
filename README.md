# SzékelyData Data Visualisation Contest Entry by Tamás Imets - Data Processing

This repository contains the tools and programs I made to analyze the 'data.json' dataset. I used Jupyter and Python for data processing and decoding then switched to JS, HTML and Django for making a website that you can check out [here](http://imetomi.pythonanywhere.com). The site basically shows where the Székelys live, where were they born, where did they move, and etc. 

## The Story
I have never tried to visualize such a big ammount of data before, but I had some experience with data handling. I knew from start that I want make a Google Earth like geographical plot. Browsing the web I found the WebGL Globe (three.js) framework and I built up the cralified data in Jupyter. This is how it looks now: [Earth](earth.jpg)
After creating the globe I used D3.js to create a beaufiful chord diagram. You can check out both of them on my website. [Chord](chord.jpg)
